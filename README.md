# ðŸ“Œ About the Project
This repository contains studies and implementations related to neural networks and simulation environments for drones. It is divided into two main folders:

## ðŸ“‚ cheats_and_lions
This folder contains studies on the use of YOLOv5 for the identification of lions and cheetahs in images and videos. YOLOv5 is a highly efficient and high-performance object detection neural network, and here we explore how it can be trained and applied for this purpose.

## ðŸ“‚ drone_envioremente
This folder focuses on studies with OpenAI Gym to create and test simulation environments for drones. These environments include:
- **2D**: Two-dimensional simulations for simpler and faster testing.
- **3D**: Three-dimensional simulations that represent a more realistic environment for drone flight.

# ðŸš€ Technologies Used
- YOLOv5
- Python
- OpenAI Gym
- Neural Networks

This repository is under constant development and contributions are welcome! ðŸŽ¯
